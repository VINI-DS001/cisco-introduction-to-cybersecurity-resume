## **Module 1 - Introduction to Cybersecurity**

### **1.1 The World of Cybersecurity**

&emsp;Cybersecurity is defined as an effort to protect individuals, businesses and governments from digital attacks. Therefore, there are 3 main types: individual, corporate, and government.

&emsp;**Online Identity**: it is important not to use your full name as a user, not to put frequent usernames and passwords or the same ones in several (financial) accounts, or to put names of companies where you work.

&emsp;**Main targets for hackers:**: medical, educational, work and financial institutions store their data in an online database, so they end up being favorite targets for hackers, so you need to be careful with what you inform.

&emsp;In addition, your data may be shared with other institutions. An example is social networks, which generate revenue by selling their users' data to market companies, in order to then generate advertisements and commercials for their users.

### **1.2 Organizational Data**

&emsp;Organizational data is divided into transactional data, purchases and sales, but can also be related to production and intellectual property of companies. Basically they are patents and trademarks, plans for new products, financial data, revenue, profit, loss, etc.

&emsp;**IoT**: It is a network of software and hardware equipment connected to the Internet, which has expanded the possibilities of data storage. This is how areas such as Big Data emerged.

&emsp;**McCumber Cube**: it is a security model created in 1991 by John McCumber establishes in 3 dimensions the fundamental principles to protect information in 3 dimensions.

**Desired goals**: confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Information states**: storage, transmission, processing.

**Safeguards**: Policy and practices, human factors and technology.

### **1.3. What Was Taken?**
&emsp;Hackers take advantage of the fragility of security systems of companies to steal personal data. An example of how data can be stolen are Exploits, software or malicious codes that exploit flaws in a computer tool, routers or other electronics.

&emsp;To increase an organization's level of protection, it is necessary to invest in good security practices, such as investing in digital security training, applying two-factor authentication, storing passwords using salting combinations.

### **1.4. Cyber Attackers**
&emsp;With cyber-attacks, hackers seek to obtain data ranging from personal information to data on secret projects of government companies.

&emsp;**Amateurs**: amateur attackers use commands and tools which are usually found on the internet.

&emsp;**White hat hacker**: work to keep data safe from other hackers and reports failures and vulnerabilities.

&emsp;**Black hat hacker**: seek to take advantage of failures for profit personal. 

&emsp;**Grey hat hacker**: may violate laws or ethical standards but doesn't have the same intent of a black hat hacker.

&emsp;**Hacker group**: are part of virtual, terrorist or activist groups.

### **1.5. Cyberwarfare**
&emsp;Cyber ​​warfare is the use of technology to carry out cyberattacks aimed at targeting a nation's infrastructure systems and networks.

## **Module 2 - Attacks, Concepts and Techniques**

### **2.1. Analyzing a Cyber Attack**
&emsp;Malware (Malicious Software) is code that steals data, violates access protocols and compromises a system. Below are listed the main types of malware.

&emsp;**Spyware**: watch and monitor online activities, can record what data is accessed, what keyboard keys are pressed. They can capture sensitive personal data.

&emsp;**Adware**: project various advertisements to the user, can occur in software but are usually present on websites.

&emsp;**Backdoor**: used by hackers to break access blocks to a system by violating authentication protocols. It gives hackers remote access to a system's resources.

&emsp;**Ransonware**: widely used in hijacking attacks, ransomware encrypts data and keeps it “imprisoned” until the ransom is paid. It is usually spread through phishing.

&emsp;**Scareware**: emits alert windows to scare and convince the user to run/download a program that will infect the system with malware.

&emsp;**Rootkit**: modifies the operating system to create a backdoor through software vulnerabilities. The rootkit can also modify the system and its tools in such a way that the computer must be wiped and the tools reinstalled.

&emsp;**Virus**: computer program that, when executed, multiplies and appends its own codes to other files. They can be executed only by the end user or at a scheduled time. They are usually spread over USB drives, optical disks and can be programmed to avoid detection. Can modify or delete files.

&emsp;**Trojan**: exploit user privileges to perform malicious actions. They do not multiply but act as decoys to sneak past unsuspecting users.

&emsp;**Worms**: malware that multiplies to spread between computers. Unlike viruses, worms run on their own, exploit system vulnerabilities, and contain payloads (malicious code).

&emsp;Signs of malware include: increased CPU usage, computer freezes or crashes frequently, files are modified or deleted, unknown icons or programs are present, unknown services are running, or even emails that are sent without the user's knowledge.

### **2.2 Methods of Infiltration**
&emsp;**Social Engineering**: is the manipulation of an individual for the purpose of obtaining confidential information.

&emsp;**Pretexting**: when a person receives a call claiming to be from an institution and they claim they need your confidential data. Ex: they call you saying they are from a bank and ask for your personal data.

&emsp;**Tailgating**: when individuals follow an authorized person to a physical location.

&emsp;**Quid pro quo**: hackers request personal information in exchange for something, like rewards or discounts.

&emsp;**DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack**: are attacks that result in the interruption of a service to users or devices. They can occur through increased traffic that the server does not support or poorly formatted packets.

&emsp;**DDoS attack**: a hacker creates several zombie hosts that proceed to attack more hosts, creating an army of zombies. When ready, the hacker orders the zombie botnet to perform a DDoS attack on a server.

&emsp;**Botnet**: grupo de robôs conectados pela internet que pode ser controlado por hackers. Esses grupos podem ser alugados por hackers para realizar ataques DDoS ou outros como ataques de senha de força bruta.

&emsp;**On-Path-Attack**: in the middle of a communication hackers can change the information transmitted between 2 devices to impersonate someone.

&emsp;**MITM (Man in the middle)**: occurs when hackers take control of the device without the user's knowledge, intercept and capture user information before it is sent.

&emsp;**MITMO (Man in the mobile)**: variation of the MITM attack. Takes control of the Mobile device and instructs it to pass transmitted information to attackers.

&emsp;**SEO Poisoning**: search tools show us the sites with the most relevant content on the first pages. SEO Poisoning occurs when hackers increase traffic to malicious pages and “push” those pages to higher positions in results.

&emsp;**WiFi network access password cracking**: Users can try to get private wireless network passwords from companies. They usually use social engineering, brute force attacks or network sniffing, listening or capturing packets sent over the network.

&emsp;**Password Attacks**: The main objective is to obtain a user's password is the easiest way for a hacker to gain access to important information. 

&emsp;Some of the most common password attacks are:

&emsp;**Password spraying**: hackers use very common passwords like “Password123” and try to access it with multiple users, allowing the user to be undetected, avoiding account lockouts.

&emsp;**Dictionary attack**:  A hacker tries frequently used dictionary words as a password.

&emsp;**Brute force**: considered the simplest way to obtain a password, the hacker will try all possible combinations until he hits the password.

&emsp;**Rainbow table attack**: passwords are stored in hash format (numeric values ​​that identify the data). To compute the hash, there is a rainbow table of precomputed values ​​that create the hash for a password. A hacker seeks to compare the hash of a password with those already existing in the rainbow table, and when he finds a match, he identifies the password.

&emsp;**Traffic interception**: unencrypted texts can be easily read by people or machines. If the password is stored in clear text, anyone with access to your device can get it.

&emsp;**Advanced persistent threat (APT)**: these are complex, multi-phase, stealthy attacks that are usually funded and target governments or organizations for commercial or political reasons.

### **2.3 Security Vulnerability and Exploits**

&emsp;Hardware vulnerabilities are introduced by flaws in the hardware. As an example, the capacitors of a RAM memory, due to their proximity, can influence neighboring capacitors. As an example below stated.

&emsp;**Meltdown & Spectre**: they are two vulnerabilities, which were discovered by Google security researchers, that affect almost all CPUs released since 1995. They are present in desktops, laptops, servers, cell phones and other smart devices and cloud services. Meltdown allows an attacker to read all data present in a system's memory, while Spectre allows data manipulated by applications to be read.

&emsp;Software vulnerabilities are introduced by bugs in the OS or application code. The main categories are:

&emsp;**Buffer Overflow**: occurs when data written to an allocated memory exceeds the buffer limits, this causes the application to access allocated memory that is intended for other processes, leading to system failures or data compromise.

&emsp;**Unvalidated Input**: Malicious files that can cause a program to misbehave, causing buffer overflows or other system-compromising issues.

&emsp;**Race Condition**: occurs when the output of an event depends on ordered/timed outputs, if events occur in an unordered way it can compromise the system.

&emsp;**Weakness in security practices**: developers may try to use their own security methods when creating an application, which brings vulnerabilities. It is recommended to always use already created algorithms and libraries.

&emsp;**Access Control**: security practices can be overcome if the attacker has access to the physical device. The hacker could read the data directly from the hard drive. Physical access should be restricted and data encrypted.

### **2.4 The Cybersecurity Landscape**

&emsp;**Cryptocurrency**: is money that is heavily protected through cryptography, used in digital transactions. Cryptocurrencies are held in digital wallets, when transactions take place the details are recorded in a decentralized accounting system, or blockchain. It is carried out with anonymity and is self-managed, without interference from third parties.

&emsp;**Cryptojacking**: security practices can be overcome if the attacker has access to the physical device. The hacker could read the data directly from the hard drive. Physical access should be restricted and data encrypted.

## **Module 3 - Protecting your Data and Privacy**

### **3.1 Protecting Your Devices and Network**
&emsp;Some of the top tips to protect your device are:

&emsp;**Activate a Firewall**: Activating a firewall prevents intruders from unauthorized access to your personal or company data.

&emsp;**Activate Anti-virus and Anti-spyware**: Software designed to check a device for viruses and spyware.

&emsp;**Manage the OS and browser**: increasing the security level to medium or high and keeping the browser constantly updated helps prevent cyber threats.

&emsp;**Configure password protection**: All computing devices must be password protected and sensitive data encrypted.

&emsp;**Wireless network security**: Wireless networks allow WiFi-enabled devices to connect to the network using the SSID, a network identifier. Hackers can use a predefined SSID password to access the network, so these details must be changed to avoid attackers.

&emsp;**Public WiFi Risks**: Using public WiFi networks to access or send confidential information can be dangerous. It's best to use a VPN to prevent others from intercepting your information.

&emsp;**Strong passwords**: it is recommended not to use words in the dictionary, use characters like $, #, *, not to put personal account names and use more than ten characters. Another tip is to use a modified phrase with characters instead of a single word, which makes it stronger against brute force and dictionary attacks.

### **3.2 Data Maintenance**
&emsp;One of the most efficient ways to protect data is Cryptography, which is formatting personal information in a way that unauthorized people cannot read it. However, this does not prevent it from being intercepted. Furthermore, criminals can encrypt your personal information and for a fee. Other ways to protect data are:

&emsp;**Backing up your data**: To prevent lost data from being unrecoverable, it is important to have a backup as well as an additional storage location. This location can be at home, an external storage device, which you are responsible for, or in the cloud, such as AWS, whose main advantage is that data is not lost in case of theft or accidents.

&emsp;**Permanent deletion of data:**: when files are deleted, they are only inaccessible by the OS, but can be recovered through code snippets. To delete them permanently, you must use tools that replace these codes with 0s and 1s. However, the only sure way to destroy the data is to destroy the physical device.

### **3.3 Who Owns Your Data?**
&emsp;Most companies have terms of service. It is a binding contract that determines the rules between the user, the service provider and other users using the service. These typically include user rights and responsibilities, provider disclaimers, and who can access your data.

&emsp;**Data Policy**: Although you own the content, the provider may reuse shared information for any purpose.

&emsp;**Signing up for online services**: when signing a contract, it is recommended to read the terms of service, what your rights are, whether you can make a copy, what the provider does when you upload and what happens when you close your account.

### **3.4 Safeguarding Your Online Privacy**
&emsp;There are many techniques and tools to protect a user's privacy on the internet. Some are:

&emsp;**Two-factor authentication**: is used to add a layer of protection to a service, and requires a user to enter a second token to access a service, such as biometrics, phone number or email verification code.

&emsp;**Open Authorization (OAuth)**: Open standard protocol that allows you to log in to a third-party service using credentials from another website. For example, sign in to Canva using your Google account.

&emsp;**Private browsing**: to minimize online browsing problems, you can use incognito browsing mode. By using it, cookies are disabled and browsing history is deleted. This prevents your information from being obtained by services and people, however several companies are developing ways to track your online data.

### **3.5 Discover Your Own Risky Online Behavior**
&emsp;Sharing photos or information that show personal data, such as bank details and vacation information, can put you at risk, especially if you share your address. In addition, it is important to always access websites and software from legitimate or reliable sources.

&emsp;**Password manager apps**: to minimize online browsing problems, you can use incognito browsing mode. By using it, cookies are disabled and browsing history is deleted. This prevents your information from being obtained by services and people, however several companies are developing ways to track your online data.

&emsp;**Password manager apps**: can generate and encrypt passwords. Manages generated passwords preventing a user from having the same passwords for multiple accounts.

## **Module 4 - Protecting the Organization**

### **4.1 Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies**
&emsp;There is no single tool that can solve all cybersecurity problems. However, they must be chosen considering their effectiveness.
Security devices can be independent, such as a router or software running on a device. They are divided into 6 categories:

&emsp;**Routers**: a router has traffic filters that can configure which computers on a network segment can connect to which network segments.

&emsp;**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Use a set of traffic signatures that match and block traffic and attacks.

&emsp;**Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**: allows people to use an encrypted tunnel to securely connect to a network.

&emsp;**Antivirus and Antimalware**: use signatures or behavioral analysis to detect malicious code and prevent it from executing.

&emsp;**Other devices**: These can be customer access and security management systems, as well as decryption devices.

&emsp;**Firewalls**: analyze network traffic and can detect suspicious behavior that needs to be blocked. A firewall can be a program installed on a computer to protect it, or a device to protect an entire network of computers. They are divided into types:

&emsp;**Layer Firewall**: it filters communications based on source and destination IP address.

&emsp;**Transport Layer Firewall**: it filters communications based on source and destination data, as well as connection states.

&emsp;**Application Firewall**: Filter based on applications, programs and services.

&emsp;In addition to firewalls, there are other services that are responsible for monitoring traffic.

&emsp;**Context-Aware Firewall**: filters network traffic based on user, device type, role and threat profile.

&emsp;**Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewall**: hides or masks private addresses of hosts.

&emsp;**Host-Based Firewall**: Filters ports and service calls on a single OS.

&emsp;**Proxy Server**: Filters web requests such as URLs, domain names and media types. There is also the reverse proxy server, which protects, hides, distributes and downloads access to web services.

&emsp;**Intrusion detection and prevention systems**: These are measures implemented in a network to detect and prevent malicious activity. 
The first is Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which can be a device or network program that scans a database for malicious traffic. Upon detecting any suspicion, it registers the occurrence and creates an alert for the administrator. IDS generally slows down the network, so it is offline and separated from regular traffic.
Then, there is the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), which blocks or deny traffic based on a rule or signature match. An IPS can integrate with third-party tools for reporting, performance, and log analysis.

&emsp;**Real-time detection**: Real-time attack detection requires constant scanning using firewall and IDS/IPS network devices. Attacks like DDoS are one of the main attacks that need to be detected in real time, and are very difficult to defend against, due to the fact that there are hundreds or thousands of zombie hosts, and the traffic still appears as legitimate.

### **4.2 Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity**
&emsp;No cybersecurity plan is foolproof, so organizations must be prepared to respond to a cyberattack. When a security breach occurs, the key actions to take are always to report the issue immediately, be honest and responsible, provide details, and find the cause.

&emsp;**Behavior-based security**: it is a form of threat detection that analyzes the communication flow between a user on a local network and a local/remote destination. If there are changes in communication patterns, it is considered an attack.

&emsp;**Honeypots**: Behavior-based detection that appeals to the default malicious behavior of the attacker. When the attacker enters the honeypot, the adm can capture it to study and analyze its behavior and better develop the defense.

&emsp;**NetFlow**: Collects data flowing across the network, including who and what devices are on the network and when and how users and devices access the network. It is an important component in behavioral detection.

&emsp;**Pen testing**: is the act of assessing a system, network, or enterprise for security vulnerabilities. The information is used to better develop the system's defenses and ensure it withstands future cyber-attacks. It is divided into the following steps:

**1.Planning and Reconnaissance**:the pen tester gathers as much information about system vulnerabilities and exploits as possible. It involves the recognition of liabilities or assets (footprinting).

**2. Scanning**: The pen tester uses active reconnaissance to look for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Port scanning, vulnerability scanning and active connection to a target.

**3. Gaining Access**: the pen tester will try to access the destination and detect the network traffic. It can use methods such as social engineering, launching payload exploits on the system, breaching physical barriers, exploiting website vulnerabilities or misconfiguration of websites.

**4. Maintaining access**: The pen tester will maintain access to find out which systems are standalone. It is important that trojams, rootkits and other channels to hide the pen tester's presence are not discovered.

**5. Analysis and reporting**: The pen tester creates feedback to recommend system updates, policies, and training to improve security.

&emsp;**Risk management**: is the process of identifying and continually updating risks to reduce the impacts of threats and vulnerabilities. A risk cannot be completely eliminated, however, acceptable levels can be determined by weighing the impact of a threat against the cost of methods to mitigate it.

### **4.3 Cisco's Approach to Cybersecurity**
Cyberthreats are constant, and because of this, many large companies have a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). In addition to providing tools for detecting and preventing accidents.

&emsp;**Security Information Event Management (SIEM)**: collects and analyzes security alerts and other historical and real-time data in order to facilitate the early detection of cyber attacks.

&emsp;**Data Loss Prevention (DLP) System**: designed to prevent confidential data from being stolen or escaping from the network. Monitors and protects data in 3 states:

**Data in Use**: Data accessed by a user.

**Data in motion**: Data in motion on the network

**Inactive Data**: Data that is stored on the network or device.

&emsp;**Security Manual**: it is a set of queries and reports that describe a standardized incident detection and response process. A security playbook should outline how to identify and automate responses to common threats, describe and define inbound and outbound traffic, provide summary information, list events across all relevant data sources.

## **Module 5 - Will Your Future Be in Cybersecurity?**

### **5.1 Legal and Ethical Issues**
&emsp;Cybersecurity professionals must have the same skills as attackers, but must operate within the confines of the law.

&emsp;**Personal legal issues**: At home or at work, you might hack someone else's computer or network. But every invasion leaves traces, which can lead to you.

&emsp;**Corporate legal issues**: Most countries have cybersecurity laws that companies must comply with. Thus, if during your work you commit a violation, you can be punished, fined or even condemned, including the organization in which you worked. If you're not sure an action is illegal, assume it's illegal.

&emsp;**International Law and Cybersecurity**: International law on cybersecurity is constantly evolving. Cyberattacks take place in cyberspace, where there are no geographic boundaries. For example, it is much easier to mask the origin of a cyber attack than an attack in conventional warfare.

### **5.2 Education and Careers**

&emsp;Cybersecurity certifications are a great way to verify the skills and knowledge obtained. Some examples include Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate and CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker).

&emsp;**Cybersecurity career paths**: specialist, cybersecurity analyst, IT auditor, cybersecurity consultant and pen tester are some careers in the cybersecurity field to pursue.
